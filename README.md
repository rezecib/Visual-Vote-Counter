# Visual Vote Counter
A small project of mine for counting votes in an auditorium during an event.

The way it works is that it reads in images of the auditorium, in which the audience is holding up colored flags. It then runs a blob-detection algorithm to detect the flags, and marks them on the image. It also allows the user to add and remove detections, as I wasn't able to get it to be as accurate as I wanted in time. When selecting an image for detection, the vote it belongs to must also be chosen. In the case I was using it, these were company pitches, so each vote is a company name.

If you want to use it for yourself, it won't be immediately usable-- I was under time-pressure and hard-coded a few things. Knowing what I do now, there are probably better approaches to this problem, such as convolutional neural nets (although this would require significantly more training data than I was able to obtain at the time), and several image normalization methods could probably be used to improve accuracy.
